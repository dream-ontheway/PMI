											<h4 class="speak_title"> Topic : Embracing the “China Opportunity”</h4>
											<img class="arrow_bottom" src="../images/jiantou.png" alt="">
											<img class="arrow_bottom1" src="../images/jiantou.png" alt="">

											<p class="speak_title_text">During the years the perceptions about “Made in China” have changed, both in China and abroad. Today China is positioning itself not only as the manufacturing center of the World, but also as the innovations engine due to which China Government is seeking to revolutionize the industrial structure of the country. For years, as a global company, COMAU has been approaching this challenging and changing market by leveraging the Group’s global competence and a never-ending wish to develop local expertise. Facing project management challenges in a dynamic context of cultural diversity and geographical distance has colored the development of the organization. Still today COMAU seeks not to eliminate this diversity, but to take in the opportunity as a source of innovation.  What is result of 15 years of development? How did COMAU embrace the China opportunity and what are the ways forward?

											<p class="speak_title_text"style="text-align:left">Getting to your destination by starting at Point A and ultimately getting to Point B is how we normally travel. Relying on a Global Positioning System (GPS) provides added directions and alternative pathways when traffic conditions change along the journey. How many of us take the time to map out our own professional career path in planning how we reach our future professional objectives and goals?
											</p>
											<p class="speak_title_text"style="text-align:left">The Project Management Institute has developed the Talent Triangle as your personal GPS to get from Point A all the way to Point Z, and to make key visits to all the other points in between. The Talent Triangle is a roadmap that lays out “must have” competencies in Technical, Leadership, and Strategic and Business areas. This focuses on developing the additional skills you need to meet the evolving demands in our profession. In doing so it also means new opportunities to elevate your value as a high demand talent in an increasingly complex and competitive global marketplace.

											<p class="speak_title_text" style="text-align:left">
												Questions have been raised about the future of project management (PM) with growing concerns that the PM has become mature and stagnant. Some recent research suggests that future of PM lies in the development of new success criteria, new key performance indicators (KPIs), dashboard design, measurement scales for KPIs, and governance.</p>
											<p class="speak_title_text" style="text-align:left">We extend upon these ideas and propose a vision for project management of 21st century with a focus on five key districts of capacity building. They are:</p>
											<p class="speak_title_text"  style="text-align:left">
												(1) Extending body of knowledge by adding in five new knowledge areas i.e. benefits management, issues / problem management, project team’s skills management, projects networks management, and blended PM (traditional/complex, traditional/virtual, cross-cultural/industry);<br/>
												(2) adaptable structures and governance of project organizations; <br/>
												(3) development of tailored / custom design methods/tools and success criteria/Project KPIs;<br/>
												(4) creativity management; and<br/>
												(5) PMO re-organization into Enterprise Project Management office.
											<p class="speak_title_text" style="text-align:left">
												As part of our vision, we present results of a survey conducted in China with experts and practitioners on their understanding of future trends in project management of 21st century. We believe these trends entail significant implications. Practitioners will require putting in place strategies to build organisational capabilities, and upskill their staff’s knowledge, develop new standards/processes/practices to deal the changes, upgrade their existing internal methodologies and frameworks to make them relevant and adaptable to the new trends. Academics will need to develop new knowledge domains, training-ware, delivery methods and research themes.</p>

How to make things different? Why project managers often feel embarrassing in the enterprises? How the scene look like above the individual project?

And it is high speed to increase global projects. In these circumstances, we need many project managers having high management ability, high management skill and global response capabilities, etc. In Japan, we are facing some big and difficult issues such as decreasing young generation because of low birthrate and retiring the veteran generation (it’s called 2015’s problem). And also our ability of global response is not so high due to various reasons including language barrier. So many organizations are trying to foster the young generations to project manager who can applying global environment, but the situation is not sweet. Therefore, we Japanese have to collaborate with foreign countries especially China or South East Asia regions. Through this presentation I introduce some key points on making collaboration with you such as </p>

												Project management has been promoted in the mainland and Taiwan for over 10 years. Now there are over 15,000 PMPs in Taiwan and over 140,000 PMPs in the mainland. Although the number increased a lot, but we still see the success rate of enterprise project is not high, the team members work so hard in project, enterprises don’t know how to support project? So, except to encourage individuals to study project management by the knowledge in PMP, the true value of project management lies in enterprise can use project management to get profit. So we need human, process, organization and tools to improve the enterprise project management maturity model and capability model. I have a lot of experience on managing international project and instructing project management in Taiwan and mainland. I will share the key of project management optimization. With my practices and experience, it also includes how to use case and diagnosis on the intelligent tools to improve project efficiency and make your work happy.

								            <p>Deputy Director of General Office of China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP)</p>
											<p>Mr. Lei Liang, Proposer of Management Breakdown Layout Analysis (MBLA), Deputy Director of General Office of China Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Group (CECEP), Leader of Group Standardization and Informatization，Professor Senior Engineer.</p>
											<p>Mr. Liang holds executive responsibilities in Fortune Global 500 companies China State Construction Engineering Corporation，SinoHydro Corporation, and CECEP preforming project management, business administration and informatization. He holds a MBA, a Bachelor of Engineering degree, and other professional qualifications such as National Registered First-class Construction Engineer and Legal Professional Qualification Certificate.</p>
											<p>Mr. Liang pioneered the method of Management Breakdown Layout Analysis (MBLA, a methodology for building Integrated Management System), taking the lead of a series of Standardization activities within CECEP for three years aiming to build a corporate wide Integrated Management System focusing on Infrastructure Management, Production & Operation. He created the Full demand, customized combination for Informatization Construction based on his experiences at CECEP. He led the creation of over ten unified information systems such as Master Data, Data Warehouse, Document Integration and Mobile Platform, enabling efficient, widespread communication throughout the company.</p>

											<img class="arrow_bottom" src="../images/jiantou.png" alt="">

											<p class="speak_title_text"style="text-align:left">
												At present, enterprises face many problems constructing Information Systems. From the owner’s prospective, large amount of time and money is spent on unsatisfactory results. Some systems even require reformation and patching on rollout. From the vendors’ prospective, every project contains abundant needs. The heavy development workload extends projects expending capital causing vendors to lose money. The roots of these problems are congenital defects in the traditional information system construction process, such as project positioning, demand analysis and construction mentality.

											</p>
											<p class="speak_title_text"style="text-align:left">To solve these problems, Mr. Liang proposes Full demand, customized combination, a new information system construction methodology and process based on the Management Breakdown Layout Analysis (MBLA). First, project positioning is based on meeting the demands of the lowest level of the company instead of meeting management needs. Second, demand analysis should follow the MECE principle, factoring in all the demands of the business, integration, operation, maintenance, safety, and environment protection. Third, the construction methodology is to provide a diverse portfolio of products and to create customized Information Systems applicable to different enterprises. Finally, Limited technical models should be used to account for different business scenarios.</p>

											<img class="arrow_bottom1" src="../images/jiantou.png" alt="">

											<p class="speak_title_text">The Art of War is a book on wisdom that researches on the strategy ‘why to fight’ and the tactics ‘how to fight’. The essence of war is projects. Thus learning The Art of War will improve project management ability. However, it fails to reveal its causal system for the limitation of literal expression. System thinking has the feature of integration. By cause and effect graph drawing, we could effectively find out the problem-solving ability of the Art of War. The methodology is also applicable to business analysis which is focused on ‘why to do’ and project management focused on ‘how to do’.</p>

											<img class="arrow_bottom" src="../images/jiantou.png" alt="">
											<img class="arrow_bottom1" src="../images/jiantou.png" alt="">
						
											<p class="speak_title_text">Project managers are often technically oriented. They are typically strong in logic, thinking rationally, and good at doing things. In contrast, they are not good in dealing with people, and not good at managing people and team. Now in the new times, projects are becoming more and more complicated, many projects are cross-functional and cross-region and even cross-culture oriented, the environment are real virtual.  At the same time, customer are becoming tougher and tougher, demands are high.
											
											</p>
											<p class="speak_title_text"style="text-align:left">In project management, one of the biggest challenge and headache PM is complaining are that PM don’t have position power, or say the hard power. It is a fact that the team members won’t directly report to the PM in most project environment. How could a PM manage and drive his team? What is interesting and somewhat funny is that PMs have to deliver the hard deliverables without any hard power. How could PM do that? </p>

											<p class="speak_title_text"style="text-align:left">Project managers are in many ways the GM of the project. In order to meet the　demanding challenge, the PM have to improve himself and transform himself along with the following three aspects:<br/>
												1. To transform from technically oriented to management oriented. <br/>
												2. To transform form management oriented to leadership oriented. <br/>
												3. To transform from execution oriented to strategically thinking oriented. 
											</p>
											<p class="speak_title_text" style="text-align:left">In short, the successful transformation of project manager plays a very import role for future project success. A little step a PM，a great leap the project team. </p>

The attempt was very successful and yielded great results: His daughter realized her dreams and was accepted to Stanford University in 2015.</p>
											<p>Upon such discovery, Mr.Wang realised that every family is made out of numerous manageable projects, and needs to be regulated via efficient and scientific means. Therefore, he co-founded the virtual community with parents of students attending prestigious academic institutes——Seed Academy, hoping to promote and popularise the application of project management ideology in families through mobile and internet technology. Seed Academy hopes to share the stories and experiences of those who have already successfully gone through the process with new parents, and strives to help parents inspire their children to become their better self.</p>
